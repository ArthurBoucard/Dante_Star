# Dante's Star
Epitech project :

Can create a random maze of any size and can also solve it, in C

### Maze format description :
• Mazes are rectangular.

• They are coded in ASCII.

• The ‘X’s represent the walls and the’*’s represent the free spaces.

• It is possible to move to the four surrounding squares (up, down, right, left).

• “Start” is in the upper left-hand corner (0;0)

• “Finish” is in the bottom right-hand corner.

• A solution is a series of free, adjacent squares, from “Start” to “Finish” included.

• “Start” and “Finish” can be occupied. In this case, there is no solution.

• The last line of the maze doesn’t terminate with a return line.

• Resolution: in order to write the solution in the maze, we use ‘o’ for the solution path.

### How ro run :
```
./solver maze.txt

./generator x y [perfect]
```

### Rules
> :exclamation: System functions and libC are allowed, but no external libraries.
